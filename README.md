## Instruction to run code
So basically we need to run make a separate python enviroment and install all requrement.txt<br>
1. So open your code editor like Vscode or which one you use. <br>
2. Now using code editor open Api folder and you will see Model folder and app.py file this is which we will run , before this make sure your enviroment has already requirment python library which is "Flask" <br>
3. now simply open app.py and in Vscode top right run the code and now if everything is perfect then code will be successfully run ,then you will see like this : <br>
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 <br>
Press CTRL+C to quit  <br>
 * Restarting with stat  <br>
 * Debugger is active!  <br>
 * Debugger PIN: 675-256-184  <br>

4. Ok now do not Press CTRL+C on local server because Model is already runing successfully on you system. <br>

# Now this time start UI which is react
1. Now simply add a different terminal on CodeEditor and do not delete flask terminal. <br>
2. Now go and read project UI folder README.md (Link: https://github.com/sagulal-netam/Diabetes-Predicter-ML-Model-/blob/main/Ui/Ml_project/README.md ) where you find a instruction section with simple explain and Boom! you will be able to run all project on System and test my model ,predict Diebetes.
