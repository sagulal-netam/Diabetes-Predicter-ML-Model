## Diabetes-Predicter-ML-Model<br>

# 1. Project Overview<br>
​This project was developed to practice and demonstrate the full lifecycle of a Machine Learning application. As I am currently revising my Data Science concepts and preparing for a professional role, I built this to move beyond just model training and into model deployment.
​It bridges the gap between a Python-based ML model and a user-friendly React interface, showing how data science can be applied to solve real-world health tracking problems.<br>
# ​2. System Architecture <br>
​The project is divided into two main parts to simulate a real-world software environment:
​The Backend (Python & Flask): This acts as the "Engine." It hosts the trained Machine Learning model and provides an API endpoint that processes incoming health data.
​The Frontend (React.js): This acts as the "Dashboard." It provides a clean UI for users to input their metrics (like Glucose, BMI, etc.) and displays the prediction result received from the backend.<br>
# 3. Key Learning Objectives<br>
​Model Integration: Successfully connecting a Scikit-Learn model to a web server using Flask.
​Full-Stack Workflow: Managing a project that requires both backend (API) and frontend (UI) services to run simultaneously.
​Environment Management: Organizing the project with requirements.txt and clear folder structures to ensure easy setup for other developers.<br>
## 4. Instruction to run code
So basically we need to run make a separate python enviroment and install all requrement.txt<br>
1. So open your code editor like Vscode or which one you use. <br>
2. Now using code editor open Api folder and you will see Model folder and app.py file this is which we will run , before this make sure your enviroment has already requirment python library which is "Flask" <br>
3. now simply open app.py and in Vscode top right run the code and now if everything is perfect then code will be successfully run ,then you will see like this : <br>
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 <br>
Press CTRL+C to quit  <br>
 * Restarting with stat  <br>
 * Debugger is active!  <br>
 * Debugger PIN: 675-256-184  <br>

4. Ok now do not Press CTRL+C on local server because Model is already runing successfully on you system. <br>

# Now this time start UI which is react
1. Now simply add a different terminal on CodeEditor and do not delete flask terminal. <br>
2. Now go and read project UI folder README.md (Link: https://github.com/sagulal-netam/Diabetes-Predicter-ML-Model-/blob/main/Ui/Ml_project/README.md ) where you find a instruction section with simple explain and Boom! you will be able to run all project on System and test my model ,predict Diebetes.
